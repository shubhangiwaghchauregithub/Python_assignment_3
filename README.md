Assignment 3
Task 1: 
Calculate Factorial Using a Function
This task defines a function to compute the factorial of a given number using a loop.

The function factorial(num) initializes a variable result to 1.

It then multiplies result by every integer from 1 up to and including num using a for loop.

The final value of result is returned as the factorial of the input number.

The user is prompted to enter a number, and the program prints the factorial of that number.


Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
This task demonstrates the use of Pythonâ€™s built-in math module for mathematical operations.

The program imports the math module.

It prompts the user to enter a number (as a float).

It then calculates and prints:

The square root of the number using math.sqrt()

The sine of the number (in radians) using math.sin()
